###Accessibility Report

**1.** As a group, answer the following questions — place your answers in a file called accessibility-report.md in your group's GitHub repository:
For each Principle of Universal Design, write 2-3 sentences — or point form notes — explaining which features of your program adhere to that principle. If you do not have any such features, you can either:  

**(a)** Describe features that you could implement in the future that would adhere to the principle or  

**(b)** Explain why the principle does not apply to a program like yours.  

- **Principle 1: Equitable Use**  
  - A feature that we could implement in the future is integrating customizable text size and contrast to help users with low vision.  
  - Other features such as subtitles and transcriptions will not work for our program, as the premise of the game is guessing the random location, and more description would give away the answer.

- **Principle 2: Flexibility in Use**  
  - We have implemented zoom functionality when the user submits their guess, allowing them to zoom into the map.  
  - We could implement adjustable timer levels, such as an easy mode with 4 minutes instead of 2 minutes and 30 seconds.

- **Principle 3: Simple and Intuitive Use**  
  - The buttons in the menu (New Round, Leaderboard, Logout) are clearly labeled, and their function is intuitive.  
  - Our ReadMe contains detailed instructions on how to play the game, complete with images.

- **Principle 4: Perceptible Information**  
  - We do not use audio instructions, so our hard-of-hearing users are not affected.  
  - As mentioned before, we could integrate features for visually impaired users, such as customizable color schemes and font sizes.

- **Principle 5: Tolerance for Error**  
  - Buttons are available to navigate between views, so if a user accidentally clicks to switch from the menu to the leaderboard, they can easily navigate back.  
  - When a user enters the wrong password, they can edit the text rather than retyping their entire login credentials.  
  - A location guess is only submitted when the user presses the submit button, preventing misclicks from affecting their performance.

- **Principle 6: Low Physical Effort**  
  - The game requires minimal physical effort. Aside from typing login credentials, the entire user interface involves simple clicks, accommodating users with limited typing ability.  
  - We could add a feature to customize the sensitivity of gestures, helping users with difficulty in precise movements to zoom or click buttons with ease.

- **Principle 7: Size and Space for Approach and Use**  
  - This principle does not apply to our program, as the user’s physical size or space requirements do not impact gameplay.


**2.** Write a paragraph (3-6 sentences) about who you would market your program towards, if you were to sell or license your program to customers. This could be a specific category of users, such as "students", or more vague, such as "people who like games". Try to give a bit more detail along with the category.

Since our game is heavily influenced by GeoGuessr (a similar location guessing game) the GeoGuessr audience would be a great place to start in terms of marketing as we have features of GeoGuessr plus additional features such as hints. Beyond that, anyone interested in guessing games, trivia or puzzle lovers would also greatly enjoy this game. Additionally, we can market this game towards schools to use in their geography class as a tool to introduce world geography, different landscapes, as well as a fun educational break from their scheduled curriculum. Since our hints feature educational content such as when the country was established and what language is largely spoken, it could be used as a learning tool in History class as well! Overall, our game has a large target audience, and users of all ages and skill levels can enjoy. 


**3.** Write a paragraph about whether or not your program is less likely to be used by certain demographics. Your discussion here should be informed by the content of our embedded ethics modules this term.
Without any of the changes specified above, this program is less likely to be used by users with mobility issues such as arthritiies, parkinsons, or carpal tunnel syndrome as our game is largely based on mouse clicks, and any hand tremors will largely affect your performance. Since our UI is largely Swing, our buttons are not very big and it would be frustrating to use if the user had such a mobility issue. Furthermore, users with vision issues would also be less likely to use our program as we dont have zoom on our swing GUI (we do on our JavaScript however). Another issue is people who are dyslexic or have other reading issues, may not use our program as we don't have the option to change fonts for the user's preference.
